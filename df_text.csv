Inequality,How skewed is the CIE towards a small set of accounts?,"Inequality among Canadian news outlets and within our broader information ecosystem refers to how concentrated (or skewed) engagement levels are across social media accounts, and whether a small subset of accounts receives a disproportionately large amount of a platform's engagement. This concept highlights how much attention and influence are concentrated among a subset of entities, affecting the diversity and plurality of voices between news outlets and within the ecosystem. High levels of inequality can lead to a scenario where a small number of accounts dominate the conversation, potentially skewing public perception and discourse. In this situation, an ecosystem is vulnerable to the spread of misinformation when the validity of, or the motives behind these sources is questionable.","We evaluate inequality using the Gini coefficient (the extent of influence within an information ecosystem deviates from a perfectly even distribution). The scale ranges from 0 (each entity has equal influence) to 1 (a single entity has all the influence). Fewer information sources (high value) severely restrict information flows, which can lead to faster spread and deeper penetration of misinformation. We measure influence by engagement with entities (number of likes, comments, and shares).",INEQUALITY
Segmentation,How divided into distinct communities is the CIE?,"Segmentation refers to the degree of separation and distinctiveness between different groups or entities in a network, like communities that form around different political ideologies. Segmentation affects the flow of information within and between distinct communities and the exposure to diverse and homogenous perspectives. High levels of segmentation can lead to echo chambers, where individuals are exposed predominantly to information that reinforces their existing beliefs. Meanwhile, low levels of segmentation can promote cross-cutting discussions and a more diverse exchange of ideas, both acting as precursors to democracy and system resilience.","We determine segmentation (or modularity) by generating and interpreting a network modularity score on a scale of 0 to 1. Calculating this score involves four steps: 1) clustering accounts (entities) into communities using Louvain clustering; 2) counting the connections (edges) between these communities; 3) estimating the number of connections accounts within these communities would have to each other, if they were not part of a community, but instead behaved completely randomly; and 4) comparing the actual number of connections inside the communities to the expected number of connections if the network were truly random. 0 implies a complete lack of community structure (complete randomness of interaction) while 1 implies that every account is entirely distinct and never interacts with one another.",SEGMENTATION
Insularity,How insular are parties relative to one another?,"Insularity refers to the degree to which communities interact (or do not interact) with each other. We focus on political parties, specifically, how often politicians engage with politicians belonging to a different party. Analyzing political communities is a useful way of gauging the anti-social behavior of members, such as if they have online discussions with other communities, how entrenched political communities are, and which groups might be isolating themselves more than others.","We measure insularity using our logic for the segmentation measure with the addition of party labels. We calculate insularity by computing the percentage of Canadian politicians' connections across the network to other politicians in the same political party for each of the three main political party families, normalized against the total number of politicians in that party. A higher score indicates that more of the connections for a given political party are to others in the same party, whereas a lower score means the inverse (more connections are to accounts outside their own party). We then report the insularity score for each party. These scores are best understood in relation to one another (how the parties compare in insularity). Less insular parties are closer to the core of the national conversation, have a less cohesive voice, and are more likely to engage with a variety of topics and individuals outside their immediate political group. ",INSULARITY
Toxic speech,How prevalent is toxic speech in the CIE?,"Toxicity in the information ecosystem refers to the presence of offensive, insulting, threatening, or attacking language in online discourse. High levels of toxicity can contribute to a hostile and divisive online environment, discourage constructive dialogue, and negatively impact mental health and community cohesion. Monitoring toxicity enables us to gauge how hostile the internet is for users and assess the risk of downward decline; it helps us develop interventions to promote more respectful and inclusive online interactions.","We measure toxicity by assessing the extent to which toxic language is present in the CIE that month. We assign each post in our dataset a toxic speech score on a scale of 0 to 1. A low toxicity score (0) suggests a low frequency of offensive or insulting content, and a high score (1) implies a high amount of toxic speech. To do so, we process each post using a supervised toxicity classifier, detoxify, which evaluates the frequency of offensive, insulting, threatening, or attacking language in that post. We then aggregate all the individual scores into one average measure on a scale of 0 to 1. We calculate the mean toxicity scores for all posts to report a toxicity score for the whole CIE in that month. ",TOXIC SPEECH
Division,How do people feel about their own political party versus other parties?,"Division is measured through affective polarization. Polarization generally refers to the extent to which opinions, beliefs, and attitudes diverge sharply between different groups. Affective polarization, specifically measures the difference in how individuals feel about members of other political parties compared to their own. High levels of polarization can undermine social cohesion, disrupt constructive political discourse, and enable social unrest.","We measure division by assessing the difference in feelings (sentiment) towards other political parties compared to one's own party. Using a method designed for multi-party systems, we first ask survey respondents: How do you feel about the federal political parties below? 
We evaluate sentiment for six major parties, namely the Conservative Party, Liberal Party, New Democratic Party (NDP), Bloc québécois, Green Party, and People's Party of Canada where survey responders choose between a number from 0 to 100. 0 means you really dislike the party and 100 means you really like the party. Then, we calculate the average feeling towards political parties for each survey respondent and then calculate an individual animosity score based on the difference between their average score and each political party, with each political party weighted as per Wagner (2021). We then average all respondent differences to generate an overall score of animosity for the population. Societies where people rate parties closer together have lower scores. ",DIVISION
News avoidance,What extent do people avoid the news?,"News avoidance refers to the tendency of individuals to deliberately avoid political & public affairs news stories. High news avoidance can lead to a less informed society, higher exposure to misinformation through unvetted sources, and a less resilient public discourse. Understanding this measure enables us to identify barriers to news engagement and develop strategies to encourage more active participation in news consumption.","We measure news avoidance by assessing how often people avoid the news when they're online. Specifically, we ask survey respondents: Whenever you are online, do you find yourself trying to avoid the news as much as possible or more interested in seeking it out? The given choices are: Constantly avoiding, Often avoiding, Occasionally avoiding, I don't try to avoid it but I don't seek it out either, Occasionally seeking out, Often seeking out, and Constantly seeking out. We report the proportion of respondents who say Constantly avoiding‚ Often avoiding‚ or Occassionally avoiding using a weighted average.",NEWS AVOIDANCE
Chilled speech,What extent do people avoid political discussion and opinion sharing?,"Chilled speech in the information ecosystem refers to the extent to which individuals feel uncomfortable or reluctant to engage or participate in the online political dialogue. A high-level of chilled speech can suppress diverse viewpoints and curtail natural choke points for mis/disinformation, reduce political engagement, and undermine democratic discourse. It can ultimately lead to a less vibrant and inclusive public sphere. ","We measure chilled speech by evaluating the extent people are comfortable voicing their political opinions online and directly responding to political content they disagree with. We ask survey respondents two questions: (1) Please indicate how comfortable you are expressing your political opinions online with choices: Not at all comfortable, Not very comfortable, Somewhat comfortable, Comfortable, and Extremely comfortable. (2) Please indicate how comfortable you are directly responding to online political news content and social media posts that you disagree with choices: Not at all comfortable, Not very comfortable, Somewhat comfortable, Comfortable, and Extremely comfortable. We then calculate the proportion who say Not at all comfortable or Not very comfortable for both questions or average the proportions to generate an overall chilled speech measure.",CHILLED SPEECH
Trust in information gatekeepers,How much do people trust each type of gatekeeper?,"Trust in the information ecosystem refers to the confidence that individuals have in the information they consume and in the sources providing that information. We assess this measure by evaluating trust in information gatekeepers who are the providers and regulators of information. Trust is crucial because it affects how people perceive and interact with news and information. High levels of trust in the information ecosystem promote civic engagement. Conversely, low levels of trust can lead to apathy and cynicism, ultimately undermining the democratic process by eroding the public's ability to make well-informed decisions.","We evaluate trust by asking Canadians about their confidence in individual information gatekeepers—journalists, media organizations, politicians, and Big Tech. We ask survey responders, How much trust, if any, do you have in information gatekeepers to act in the best interests of Canadians? The given choices are No trust at all, Very little trust, A fair amount of trust, and A lot of trust. For each information gatekeeper, we take the weighted average of respondents that report A fair amount of trust or A lot of trust. We also measure trust collectively in all information gatekeepers by averaging values from four categories to obtain an overall trust level.",TRUST IN INFORMATION GATEKEEPERS
Discussion about misinformation and foreign interference,How often do people post about misinformation and foreign interference?,"Discussion about mis/disinformation and foreign influence is measured to assess the level of attention it is getting. Specifically, we examine how often prominent accounts within the CIE discusses these topics to provide an additional dimension to our analysis. ","We evaluate the discussion about misinformation and foreign influence by calculating the frequency of mentions about misinformation, disinformation, foreign interference, fake news, and deepfakes. We do so by counting how many times these and related terms, in English or French, appear in posts in the CIE during that month. We report this measure as a percentage of how many posts mention misinformation and/or related terms out of all posts from that month as an indicator of attentiveness to misinformation.",DISCUSSION ABOUT MISINFORMATION AND FOREIGN INTERFERENCE
Links to known misinformation websites,How common and popular are web links to known misinformation websites?,"Links to known misinformation websites are measured to help us gauge how much misinformation is circulated by politically influential accounts in the CIE. It does not represent the total amount of misinformation since it would require us to analyze every single post across multiple platforms in Canada. To provide understanding, we focus on the volume of links to known misinformation sites shared by prominent accounts. This value provides insight into how prominent misinformation is online in Canada. By looking at how often the most prominent voices in the CIE share misinformation, and how much engagement is generated by that misinformation, we can begin to understand how much misinformation may be circulating in Canada, from whom, and how much attention that misinformation is getting. ","We measure links to known misinformation websites by looking at the prevalence of web linking to misinformation websites. We extract the web links for all posts, expand any that have been shortened by url shorteners, and clean all references to common websites are removed (e.g. youtube.com, twitter.com, facebook.com, instagram.com, t.me, google.com, whatsapp.com, apple.co). We then calculate prevalence by identifying all posts in our dataset that contain the URL of a Global Disinformation Index catalogue of  known misinformation websites. We report this as a percentage of how many posts that month contained a link to a known misinformation site as well as the percentage of engagement with posts that contain any URL represented by posts with the URL of a known misinformation site. This is calculated by summing the total engagement received by posts with a misinformation site URL, then dividing this by the total sum of engagement received by posts with any URL.",LINKS TO KNOWN MISINFORMATION WEBSITES
Concern about Generative AI,How concerned are people about artificial intelligence?,"Concern about artificial intelligence (Generative AI) is measured to evaluate how preoccupied people are about the threat of artificial intelligence-generated content to Canadian democracy. People can create images and video content of any kind using generative AI tools, including content featuring politicians or other public figures. These deepfakes often look real unless they are closely inspected, and can lead people to believe things about politicians that are not actually true but shape their political opinions nonetheless. ","We measure concern about AI by evaluating the extent Canadians think AI-generated content misleading the public is a problem. We ask survey respondents: How concerned are you about AI-generated content misleading the public? The given choices are: Not a problem, A minor problem, A moderate problem, A serious problem, and A very serious problem. We then calculate and report the weighted average of respondents who report a serious problem or a very serious problem. ",CONCERN ABOUT GENERATIVE AI
Concern about misinformation,How concerned are people about misinformation?,"Concern about misinformation refers to how concerned Canadians are about misinformation, particularly as it affects democracy. Level of concern helps us gauge the capacity of the CIE to manage misinformation if Canadians are highly concerned about misinformation, then they may be more likely to carefully review sources of information and look out for coordinated disinformation campaigns. While this measure does not capture the scale and nature of misinformation, it also allows us to evaluate the perceived problem of misinformation in Canada. Concern about misinformation may not always be a good thing, particularly in large doses. If Canadians are increasingly paranoid about the circulation of misinformation online, then they may begin to distrust otherwise reliable sources like reputable news organizations or accuse true information of being false. ","We measure how concerned people are about misinformation by assessing the extent to which people think online misinformation is a problem. We ask survey respondents: How concerned are you about online misinformation? The given choices are: Not a problem, A minor problem, A moderate problem, A serious problem, and A very serious problem. We calculate and report the weighted average of respondents who report a serious problem or a very serious problem.",CONCERN ABOUT MISINFORMATION
Concern about foreign influence,How concerned are people about foreign influence?,"Concern about foreign influence refers to the extent Canadians are concerned about foreign governments influencing Canadian media and politics. We measure concern to be able to track if concern rises or drops over time, and inform national discussion about foreign influence and interference. ","We measure how concerned Canadians are about foreign influence by measuring the extent people think foreign governments influencing Canadian media and politics are a problem. We ask survey respondents: How concerned are you about foreign governments influencing Canadian media and politics? The given choices are: Not a problem, A minor problem, A moderate problem, A serious problem, and A very serious problem. We calculate and report the weighted average of respondents who report a serious problem or a very serious problem. We also measure how concerned Canadians are about foreign influence by specific countries. We ask survey respondents: Which country or countries do you think try to influence Canadian politics and elections through covert, deceptive, and sometimes threatening means? The given choices are: China, India, Russia, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom. We calculate and report the weighted average of respondents who select each country in response to this question.",CONCERN ABOUT FOREIGN INFLUENCE
Directed foreign influence,To what extent are overt foreign influencers impacting the CIE?,"Directed foreign influence measures how connected prominent foreign accounts are to the CIE. We specifically focus on India, Russia, and China, as these countries are often invoked in conversations about foreign interference in Canada. Rather than interference, we focus our lens on foreign influence. We assess how close are foreign accounts to Canadian accounts regarding the content they share. We can understand these accounts to be in close proximity to the CIE if they frequently post similar links or discuss certain topics at the same time and in the same way. This measure, therefore, does not describe if or how foreign governments are influencing Canadian perception. It mostly just points out the overlapping parts of our digital information ecosystems. However, in the case that a foreign government does interfere in a Canadian election, we will hopefully be able to identify the campaign, inform the public, and defend Canadian electoral integrity by regularly analyzing the connection of accounts from potential adversaries to the CIE.","We measure directed foreign influence by evaluating the proximity of prominent foreign accounts to the CIE. We track a core set of accounts associated with foreign entities (India, Russia, China) with a record of influencing Canadian politics, then integrate those accounts into the web linking, hashtag, mentions, and textual similarity network model. We then compute the percentage of all connections between Canadian and these foreign entities. A higher percentage is indicative of common posting behaviour between Canadian entities and foreign ones.",DIRECTED FOREIGN INFLUENCE
News seeking,How many Canadians seek out information about the news?,News seeking refers to the extent to which Canadians seek out information about the news.  A high value (100) implies a larger appetite for news (constantly seeking out) while a lower value (0) implies more news avoidance.,"We measure news seeking by evaluating the extent people are seeking out news.
