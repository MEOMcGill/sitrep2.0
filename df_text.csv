Segmentation,"We evaluate inequality using the gini coefficient 
           (the extent influence within an information ecosystem deviates from a perfectly even distribution). 
           The scale ranges from 0 (each entity has equal influence) to 1 (a single entity has all the influence). 
           Fewer information sources (high value) severely restricts information flows, which can lead to faster spread 
           and deeper penetration of misinformation."
Inequality,"We evaluate polarization through segmentation (the extent a network is divided into distinct communities, 
           0=low segmentation and 1=high segmentation)."
Insularity,"We evaluate insularity (the extent political party families engage with others outside their political party, with a higher number 
            representing a more insular party family)."
Toxic speech,"We evaluate toxicity through toxic speech (presence of toxic speech among posts by political influencers, with lower values indicating lower toxicity)."

News Avoidance,"We evaluate news avoidance (extent people avoid the news all together, 0=low to 1=high)."
Trust,"We evaluate trust by asking Canadians about their confidence in information gatekeepers (journalists, media organizations, politicians, and big tech)."
Chilled speech,"We evaluate chilled speech (extent people avoid online political discussion and opinion sharing, 0=low to 1=high)."
