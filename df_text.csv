Inequality,How skewed is the CIE towards a small set of accounts?,"We evaluate inequality using the Gini coefficient 
           (the extent influence within an information ecosystem deviates from a perfectly even distribution). 
           The scale ranges from 0 (each entity has equal influence) to 1 (a single entity has all the influence). 
           Fewer information sources (high value) severely restrict information flows, which can lead to faster spread 
           and deeper penetration of misinformation.",INEQUALITY
