Inequality,How skewed is the CIE towards a small set of accounts?,"We evaluate inequality using the Gini coefficient 
           (the extent influence within an information ecosystem deviates from a perfectly even distribution). 
           The scale ranges from 0 (each entity has equal influence) to 1 (a single entity has all the influence). 
           Fewer information sources (high value) severely restrict information flows, which can lead to faster spread 
           and deeper penetration of misinformation."
Segmentation,How divided is the CIE into distinct communities?,"We evaluate polarization through segmentation (the extent a network is divided into distinct communities, 
           0=low segmentation and 1=high segmentation)."
Insularity,How insular are major political parties relative to one another?,"We evaluate insularity (the extent political party families engage with others outside their political party, with a higher number 
            representing a more insular party family)."
Toxic speech,How prevalent is toxic speech in the CIE?,"We evaluate toxicity through toxic speech (presence of toxic speech among posts by political influencers, with lower values indicating lower toxicity)."
Division,How people feel about their own political party versus other parties?,Division: Text TBD
News Avoidance,To what extent do people avoid political and public affairs news?,"We evaluate news avoidance (extent people avoid the news all together, 0=low to 1=high)."
Trust,How much do people trust information gatekeepers?,"We evaluate trust by asking Canadians about their confidence in information gatekeepers (journalists, media organizations, politicians, and big tech)."
Chilled speech,To what extent do people avoid political discussion and opinion sharing?,"We evaluate chilled speech (extent people avoid online political discussion and opinion sharing, 0=low to 1=high)."
